## Overview

Hestia is a dyconit system developed as part of a master's thesis project. The thesis extends the concept of dynamic consistency, originally introduced by Dyconits, to a broader range of applications. Dyconits are a novel technique for managing optimistic inconsistency by allowing users to set bounds and policies. This project explores how Dyconits can be applied in event-driven systems to enable optimistic inconsistency across a variety of event types and scenarios, including smart farming, chat applications, and real-time analysis.

## Usage

To get started with Hestia, follow these steps:
1. Clone the git repository.
2. To start the dyconit overlord, navigate to the dyconit folder and run `dotnet run`.
3. For the consumer and producers, navigate to the star or trans topology folder and run a consumer or producer in a separate terminal.

For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the [thesis PDF](thesis.pdf) located in the root of the git repository.
